## View your markdown file via a browser

On GitHub, **README.md** is everywhere. If you edit a markdown file locally, you probably want to view it before pushing it onto GitHub.

When I searched for a **FREE** markdown viewer, I failed to find one free and simple. The markdown viewers on both *Notepad++* and *VS Code* are not friendly to use, unfortunately.

So I asked **Copilot** to write one. And here it is. Enjoy!
